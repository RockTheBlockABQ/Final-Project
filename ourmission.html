        <h2>Our Mission</h2>

        <section>
            <p>
                At Rock The Block, our mission is to create a vibrant community that celebrates and supports local artists and musicians. We believe in the transformative
                power of art and music to bring people together, foster creativity, and inspire change. We have come together to create a collective to bring the community 
                together as well as allow artists to share their art. Not everyone can afford tickets for music shows, this free communal event allows everyone to be a part of
                our beautiful movement.

                We aim to provide a platform for emerging talent and create opportunities for collaboration and growth within the artistic community. Through events, live art,
                and exhibitions, we strive to uplift voices and share diverse perspectives. All genres of artists are welcome! We strive to keep music alive and bring people 
                together. Our ability to partner with The MotherShip Alumni Art Gallery assists in giving artists a boost in their personal careers.
